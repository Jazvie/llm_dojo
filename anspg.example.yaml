# ANSPG Configuration Example
# Copy this to anspg.yaml and customize for your battles

# Game settings
game:
  time_limit_s: 300      # Time limit per turn (seconds)
  max_turns: 10          # Maximum number of turns before game ends
  rulebook: mathlib      # Rulebook: basic, mathlib, competition
  
  # Simp policy controls how the "simp" tactic can be used:
  # - "allowed": No restrictions (default, good for beginners)
  # - "no_auto_simp": Theorems solvable by simp alone are rejected
  #                   (prevents "layup" theorems, forces non-trivial proposals)
  # - "banned": simp and related tactics (aesop, decide, etc.) are removed
  #             (hardcore mode, forces fully manual proofs)
  simp_policy: banned

# Default settings for all agents (can be overridden per-agent)
agent_defaults:
  temperature: 0.3             # LLM temperature (0 = deterministic, 1 = creative)
  max_tokens: 1000              # Maximum tokens in LLM response
  difficulty_target: 0.4       # Target difficulty (0 = trivial, 1 = very hard)
  max_conjecture_attempts: 2   # Retries when theorem generation fails

# Per-agent configuration (inherits from agent_defaults)
agents:
  agent_a:
    name: GPT-OSS-20B
    model: openai/gpt-oss-20b
    # Override defaults for this agent:
    temperature: 0.3
    difficulty_target: 0.3
  
  agent_b:
    name: Mistral-Small
    model: mistralai/mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501
    # Uses agent_defaults for other settings

# Logging and debugging
logging:
  verbose: false              # Show detailed proof steps and errors
  show_failed_attempts: false  # Show why shot attempts failed
  show_proof_details: false   # Show full tactic sequences
