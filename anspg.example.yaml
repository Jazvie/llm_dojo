# ANSPG Configuration Example
# Copy this to anspg.yaml and customize for your battles

# Game settings
game:
  time_limit_s: 300      # Time limit per turn (seconds)
  max_turns: 10          # Maximum number of turns before game ends
  rulebook: mathlib      # Rulebook: basic, mathlib, competition

# Default settings for all agents (can be overridden per-agent)
agent_defaults:
  temperature: 0.3             # LLM temperature (0 = deterministic, 1 = creative)
  max_tokens: 500              # Maximum tokens in LLM response
  difficulty_target: 0.4       # Target difficulty (0 = trivial, 1 = very hard)
  max_conjecture_attempts: 3   # Retries when theorem generation fails

# Per-agent configuration (inherits from agent_defaults)
agents:
  agent_a:
    name: GPT-4o-Mini
    model: gpt-4o-mini
    # Override defaults for this agent:
    temperature: 0.5
    difficulty_target: 0.6
  
  agent_b:
    name: Claude-Sonnet
    model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
    # Uses agent_defaults for other settings

# Logging and debugging
logging:
  verbose: false              # Show detailed proof steps and errors
  show_failed_attempts: true  # Show why shot attempts failed
  show_proof_details: false   # Show full tactic sequences
